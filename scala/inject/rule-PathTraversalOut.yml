  message: |
    A file is opened to write to its contents. The filename comes from an input parameter. If an
    unfiltered parameter is passed to this file API, files at an arbitrary filesystem location
    could be modified. This rule identifies potential path traversal vulnerabilities. In many
    cases, the constructed file path cannot be controlled by the user.
