  message: |
    Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized data and turning it back
    into an object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may
    attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the
    deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized
    data but are read in during deserialization.

    Consider safer alternatives such as serializing data in the JSON format. Ensure any format
    chosen allows
    the application to specify exactly which object types are allowed to be deserialized.
    Additionally, when
    deserializing, never deserialize to base object types like `Object` and only cast to the exact
    object
    type that is expected.

    To protect against mass assignment, only allow deserialization of the specific fields that are
    required. If this is not easily done, consider creating an intermediary type that
    can be serialized with only the necessary fields exposed.

    Do note that `XMLEncoder` and `XMLDecoder` are not recommended. If the application must
    use this serialization method, use a custom ClassLoader to prevent loading of arbitrary
    classes:
    ```
    XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder(inputStream, null, null, new ClassLoader() {
        @Override
        protected Class<?> loadClass(String name, boolean resolve) throws ClassNotFoundException {
            if (!name.equals(NameOfBeanHere.class.getName()) &&
    !name.equals(XMLDecoder.class.getName())) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt: " + name);
            }

            return super.loadClass(name, resolve);
        }
    });
    ```
